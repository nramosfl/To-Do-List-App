# To-Do-List-App
1.	INTRODUCTION

The To-Do List App project is intended to create a robust and user-friendly application to assist individuals in successfully managing their daily activities. The project's primary goal was to design a multifunctional tool that not only helps with work management but also boosts productivity with a streamlined user interface and intuitive functionalities. The To-Do List application enables to manage the creation, deletion, edition, and arrangement of tasks. 

1.1.	Problem Statement

Good time and task management are critical to personal and professional success in today's fast-paced environment. Traditional task management solutions frequently fall short of meeting the flexibility and accessibility needs of current users. While various digital solutions are available, their usability, feature set, and accessibility differ substantially, leaving a gap in user satisfaction and functionality. Our To-Do List App aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive solution combining simplicity and robust task management capabilities. The program allows users to create, organize, and monitor projects and set priorities, due dates, and reminders, making it suitable for anybody from students to professionals seeking an effective way to keep track of their duties.

2.	DESIGN 

The structure of our application is carefully organized into two main programs, incorporating essential modules for system interactions and task management. The main application contains three classes that drive the user interface and interactions. The behavior of our application, as experienced by users, involves interaction with an interface where tasks can be created, modified, and organized effectively. This section discusses how users navigate through various states of the application, from viewing tasks to manipulating their details and order. Finally, the testing section of our paper outlines our approach to ensuring functionality and reliability. By detailing these three critical aspects, we aim to convey the comprehensive development process and the operational efficacy of our task management application.


3.	CONCLUSION

The task management application developed by our group presents a visually appealing design that users may find simple and easy. It also operates on a concept that aligns well with the fundamental needs of task management for users. However, the application currently falls short in terms of functionality when compared to other leading apps in the market. There are technical issues that have been identified, which must be resolved to enhance user experience and reliability. Addressing these shortcomings is crucial for our app to compete effectively with other task management solutions and to meet the expectations of our users. 

3.1 Challenges

A significant challenge encountered during the development of our application includes transitioning from the Tkinter framework to PyQt6. Originally, our application was built using Tkinter, where basic functionalities such as delete, edit, and create tasks were implemented effectively. However, we faced persistent issues with the GUI not refreshing automatically upon closure of prompt boxes, and our interface did not look like our initial design. To fix this issue and make our GUI closer to our proposed idea, PyQt6 was necessary. The shift to PyQt6 necessitated a substantial rewrite of our program. Many functions initially designed with Tkinter elements, such as the list box for displaying and sorting information, had to be either discarded or significantly modified due to the differences in how PyQt6 handles GUI components. For instance, PyQt6 manages user input differently, storing references to memory locations rather than direct access to the input data. This required us to implement a system where input data is captured in labels with updates to display user entries in plain text.
Initially our GUI concept had boxes for individual tasks, however with these display issues they had to be merged into one widget with a set amount of tasks. We settled on seven. From there the organization of these variables was by assigning the visible categories (task name, description, date, and time) into their own respective list. The text assignment would use the index of the list to assign each task their respective row. By doing this, the program assumes that there is already something in the task_id columns 1-7 of database.csv. That assumption would break our program in the case that there isn’t a database.csv file already created. The problem comes from the access of the csv file and the creation of it; it doesn’t fill out task_id 1-7, only creating the categories. If the program runs the database having any less than 7 task_id’s, then the display will fail as the index will be out of range. One final consequence of that assumption is that it doesn’t display any created tasks. When the program opens, the highest task_id is 7. The create_task and get_last_task_id functions still work and update the database file, but it will create it with task_id = 8, thus not being displayed on the GUI. These can be fixed through changing our methodology of displaying the tasks. Fixes could possibly be looking into a scrollable list or changing how user input is obtained to avoid many conversions to plain text, etc. 

3.2 Future Improvements

Upon addressing the current issues, enhancing our application with additional functionality could significantly improve its utility and user satisfaction. Integrating features such as setting reminders and enabling these alerts to appear on the user's screen, and also expanding on the options for arranging tasks would provide greater usability. By broadening the ways in which tasks can be viewed and organized, we cater to a wider range of user preferences and workflows, making our app not only a tool for task management but a comprehensive solution for personal and professional organization.
